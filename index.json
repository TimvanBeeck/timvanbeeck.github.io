We introduce and analyze hybrid discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, which are stable and convergent for any polynomial degree greater or equal than one and are computationally more efficient than discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. Additionally, the methods are stable with respect to the drastic changes in the magnitude of the coefficients occurring in stars. The analysis is based on the concept of discrete approximation schemes and weak T-compatibility, which exploits the weakly T-coercive structure of the equation.","tags":[],"title":"Hybrid discontinuous Galerkin discretizations for the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Patrick E.

Korteweg fluids are ones where the stress tensor depends on density gradients; nematic Korteweg fluids further depend on a nematic director describing the orientation of the (anisotropic) molecules. We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to these equations for suitable (nonresonant) wave numbers and propose convergent discretizations for their numerical solution. The discretization of these equations is nontrivial as they demand high regularity and involve unfamiliar boundary conditions; we address these challenges by using high-order conforming finite elements, and enforcing the boundary conditions with Nitsche's method. We illustrate our analysis with numerical simulations in two dimensions.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis and numerical analysis of the Helmholtz-Korteweg equation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.   -- ","date":1740355200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1740355200,"objectID":"54d51625676fec8239a2ee5ae4bd0c49","permalink":"https://timvanbeeck.github.io/talk/mathematics-of-wave-phenomena-2025/","publishdate":"2025-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mathematics-of-wave-phenomena-2025/","section":"event","summary":" ","tags":["Speaker"],"title":"Mathematics of Wave Phenomena 2025","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.   -- ","date":1733788800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733788800,"objectID":"d36949d89e6942a70273ff5fc746ad3b","permalink":"https://timvanbeeck.github.io/talk/pavia-applied-mathematics-seminar/","publishdate":"2024-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pavia-applied-mathematics-seminar/","section":"event","summary":" ","tags":["Speaker"],"title":"Pavia -

The key is to formulate the divergence-constraint on the active mesh, instead of the physical domain, in order to obtain robustness with respect to cut configurations without the need for a stabilization that pollutes the mass balance. This change in the formulation results in a slight inconsistency, but does not affect the accuracy of the flux variable. By applying post-processings for the scalar variable, in virtue of classical local post-processings in body-fitted methods, we retain optimal convergence rates for both variables and even the superconvergence after post-processing of the scalar variable. We present the method and perform a rigorous a-priori error analysis of the method and discuss several variants and extensions. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of divergence-preserving unfitted finite element methods for the mixed Poisson problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.   -- ","date":1683849600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683849600,"objectID":"fa94b5f204e3d30c07775a72e251b3e4","permalink":"https://timvanbeeck.github.io/talk/european-finite-element-fair-2023/","publishdate":"2023-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/european-finite-element-fair-2023/","section":"event","summary":" ","tags":["Speaker"],"title":"European Finite Element Fair 2023","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
