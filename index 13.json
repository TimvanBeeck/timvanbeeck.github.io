The key is to formulate the divergence-constraint on the active mesh, instead of the physical domain, in order to obtain robustness with respect to cut configurations without the need for a stabilization that pollutes the mass balance. This change in the formulation results in a slight inconsistency, but does not affect the accuracy of the flux variable. By applying post-processings for the scalar variable, in virtue of classical local post-processings in body-fitted methods, we retain optimal convergence rates for both variables and even the superconvergence after post-processing of the scalar variable. We present the method and perform a rigorous a-priori error analysis of the method and discuss several variants and extensions. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of divergence-preserving unfitted finite element methods for the mixed Poisson problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.   -- ","date":1683849600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683849600,"objectID":"fa94b5f204e3d30c07775a72e251b3e4","permalink":"https://timvanbeeck.github.io/talk/european-finite-element-fair-2023/","publishdate":"2023-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/european-finite-element-fair-2023/","section":"event","summary":" ","tags":["Speaker"],"title":"European Finite Element Fair 2023","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
